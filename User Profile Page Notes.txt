If Shop Name is NULL:
[ BECOME A VENDOR button ] -> pops up CREATE A STORE Form

CREATE A STORE FORM:
Shop Name 
Store Logo Image

Submit creates a store page and redirects to it

* While Shop Name is nullable in profile creation, these fields are NOT NULLABLE here. If you hit the button by accident, the only way out is through the cancel button.

** huh. Because stores don't have a model of their own and all information tied to them is stored in other models, store creation and then displaying specific store info might be something of a pain in the ass. Shouldn't be impossible though.


If Shop Name is NOT NULL:
[ MANAGE STORE button ] -> Links to Shop Page*

*Manage Store button on Nav Bar and in Profile Page should be only ways to access your own shop- your own shop should NOT appear on the home page or through the search functions.


[ REVIEWS COMPONENT ]:
Show off a list of all reviews made by this user. Public. Should function identically to Sample Reviews & All Reviews components on vendor page, but ONLY show Reviews made by this user.
