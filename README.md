## Overview
A full stack application that purports to the theme of the Etsy website, with a focus on two main features: Products and Reviews, and several partial CRUD features including Search, Orders, and Cart. When the user first accesses the site, they are brought to a splash page, greeting the user and prompting them to sign up. Attempting to access any page on the site without login/signup will redirect them to login.
